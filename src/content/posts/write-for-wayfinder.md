## Welcome to Wayfinder

Wayfinder is built on a simple belief: **honesty beats hype, community beats algorithm-chasing, and real value trumps viral tricks every time.**

We're not here to teach you 37 ChatGPT hacks or promise you'll 10x your productivity with one weird trick. We're here to share what actually works—backed by real data, honest failures, and lessons learned from getting our hands dirty.

If you've been looking for a place where you can write about what you've actually learned (not just what sounds good in a headline), where vulnerability is valued over polish, and where building genuine community matters more than gaming metrics—welcome home.

## What Wayfinder Is About

Wayfinder focuses on **practical insights for creators, entrepreneurs, and people figuring things out as they go.**

Our core content areas:

**Business & Entrepreneurship**

- Starting and growing businesses without the Silicon Valley BS
- Real revenue strategies and monetization experiments
- Practical tools and frameworks that actually work
- Lessons from failures (we have plenty)

**Content Creation & Medium Strategy**

- Honest takes on what works on Medium (and what doesn't)
- Building sustainable creator businesses
- Community-first content strategies
- SEO, structure, and storytelling that respects readers

**Productivity & Personal Growth**

- Time management strategies that account for being human
- Habit building without toxic hustle culture
- Mental health and wellness for creators
- Emotional intelligence and self-awareness

**Technology & AI**

- Calling BS on AI hype cycles with actual data
- Practical tech reviews from real-world use
- Critical thinking about tech trends
- Tools and platforms that genuinely solve problems

What connects all of this? **We prioritize substance over style, data over dogma, and community over clicks.**

## The Spirit of Our Community

Before we get into the technical guidelines, let's talk about what makes Wayfinder different.

**Honesty Over Perfection:**
We value writers who admit when they don't know something, share their failures alongside their wins, and treat readers like intelligent humans instead of engagement metrics.

**Data Over Hype:**
If you're making claims, back them up. Real numbers, cited sources, and actual experience matter more than "trust me bro" assertions.

**Community Over Commerce:**
Yes, we all want to make money from our writing. But we do it by providing genuine value, not by manipulating readers or gaming systems.

**Nuance Over Hot Takes:**
The internet loves extremes. We love thoughtful analysis. "It depends" is a valid answer when followed by actual reasoning.

## Who Should Write for Wayfinder

You're a good fit if you:

- Have actually done the thing you're writing about (not just read about it)
- Can back up your claims with data, examples, or honest personal experience
- Write to help readers, not just to rank in search
- Value community building over follower counts
- Aren't afraid to admit when something didn't work
- Can be critical without being cruel
- Want to build something sustainable, not just chase viral moments

You're probably not a good fit if you:

- Write primarily AI-generated content
- Focus on clickbait over substance
- Promote get-rich-quick schemes or MLM strategies
- Can't cite sources or provide evidence for claims
- Write generic advice that could apply to anyone/anything
- Prioritize going viral over providing value

## Content Guidelines

### What We're Looking For

**Experience-Based Content:**

- "Here's what I learned building X" beats "10 ways to build X"
- Real case studies with actual numbers
- Lessons from failures (these often perform best)
- Behind-the-scenes looks at experiments and tests

**Data-Backed Analysis:**

- Research-supported arguments
- Cited sources (no "studies show" without linking the study)
- Real examples and case studies
- Screenshots, charts, or data visualizations when relevant

**Practical How-Tos:**

- Step-by-step guides based on real implementation
- Tools and frameworks you actually use
- Specific examples, not vague platitudes
- Honest assessment of what works (and what doesn't)

**Thoughtful Commentary:**

- Critical analysis of trends and hype cycles
- Nuanced takes on complex topics
- Questioning conventional wisdom (with evidence)
- Connecting dots between different domains

### What We Don't Accept

**AI-Generated Content:**
No AI-written articles, even if labeled as such. AI tools for editing and research are fine, but the writing and thinking must be human.

**Plagiarism:**
Original work only. If you're building on someone else's ideas, cite them. Reposting your own previously published work is fine if you mention it.

**Clickbait Without Substance:**
Compelling headlines are great. Headlines that promise what the article doesn't deliver are not.

**Unsupported Claims:**
"Studies show," "experts say," or "it's been proven" without citations will be rejected.

**Generic Advice:**
If your article could be written by someone who's never done the thing, it's too generic.

**Promotional Content:**
Articles that exist primarily to sell a product/service rather than provide value.

**Offensive Content:**
No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or content that dehumanizes others. This should go without saying, but here we are.

## Submission Requirements

### Length

**800-3,000 words** is the sweet spot. Shorter is fine if you make every word count. Longer is fine if the depth warrants it.

### Format

- **Draft submissions only** (submit via Medium's draft system)
- Include a **hero image** (we can help if you need one)
- Use **clear section headers** for scannability
- **Cite sources** with hyperlinks or footnotes
- Add relevant **tags** (including "Wayfinder" if you want to help us grow)

### Structure

Your article should include:

- **Hook:** Grab attention in the first 100 words
- **Problem/Context:** Why does this matter?
- **Content/Solution:** The meat of your piece
- **Takeaway:** What should readers remember?

Bonus points for:

- Data visualizations or screenshots
- Real examples with specific details
- Honest assessment of limitations
- Links to related resources

### Technical Requirements

**Images:**

- Unsplash, Pexels, or your own images (properly attributed)
- AI-generated images are fine if cited as such
- Label personal images as "Author's image" or similar

**Citations:**

- Link directly to sources when possible
- Use footnotes for references
- No "studies show" without linking the actual study

**Grammar:**

- Run your work through Grammarly or similar tool
- We'll edit for minor errors, but clean copy moves faster

**Promotional Content:**

- Links to your other work, newsletter, or services are fine
- Just make sure the article provides value beyond the promotion
- Heavy sales pitches go to the back of the queue

## Our Content Niches

**Primary Focus:**

## A Note from Athena

Hey there,

I started Wayfinder because I was tired of the fake-it-till-you-make-it culture dominating online content. I wanted a place where honesty matters more than hype, where community beats algorithm-chasing, and where we can all figure things out together.

This publication reflects my values:

- [Calling out AI productivity theater with data](https://medium.com/followayfinder/ai-productivity-theater-fb88c9c63ae4)
- [Building community through gifting memberships](https://athenawayfinder.medium.com/gift-medium-membership-13a9de6acc74)
- [Sharing real experiments like switching to Pixel](https://medium.com/followayfinder/iphone-to-pixel-transition-guide-fb0bfc28ffcb)
- [Questioning NVIDIA's valuation before it was cool](https://medium.com/followayfinder/sell-nvidia-872463d5e498)

We're not perfect. We miss deadlines (like this newsletter that was due the 28th but came out the 29th). We experiment and sometimes fail. We're learning as we go.

But we're doing it honestly, openly, and with a community-first mentality that creates real value instead of just chasing metrics.

If that resonates with you, welcome to Wayfinder. Let's build something that lasts.

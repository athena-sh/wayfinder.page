## My Previous Milestone

Previously, I wrote the below article asking for community assistance to climb the Everest of Medium.com milestones … get 1000 followers!

> Don't worry; I will share something helpful to other writers on the platform to add value to this post besides just asking for help!

## The 30-second rule

As writers, it's challenging enough to get noticed and, hopefully, monetized. Previously, I wrote a compelling and engaging article about the power of 50 claps.

Similar to the power of 50, **read time is essential for success**.

The [30-second read time rule](/posts/medium-30-second-read-time-rule) is a metric Medium leverages to decide article value and relevance.

That's it, short and sweet! Let's work together to learn and improve our writing success!

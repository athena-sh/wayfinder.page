_Series: Wayfinder's Medium Monetization Tips_

### Partner Program Background

I've previously written the well-received articles below, which I feel are in a series. This post continues to raise awareness of the various "gotchas" on the Medium platform.


Why am I sharing this? I like to get paid (and won't _if readers leave before_ **30 seconds**), and I enjoy helping others, specifically with

- Eureka moments,
- Solutions to challenges that stump me,
- Or simply when something isn't well documented or widely known.

### **Why 30 Seconds Make a World of Difference**

Do you know that feeling of stumbling upon a gem of an article that sucks you right in? Medium's betting on that   —  requiring us to hang around for at least 30 seconds before our views count towards compensating the author. It's their way of saying, "Hey, quality time here means quality pay for our writers." And honestly? It's pretty cool.

### Also …

It's important **not to clap** or **comment** \*until **after** those precious **30 seconds\***. Why? The algorithm assumes it hasn't been read. How would you know if you like the article or have a comment ready if you just landed on the page?

> **Crafting Content That Sticks**

So, how do you craft an article that makes readers forget about their ever-growing browser tabs? It's all about the hook, the story, and a dash of personality. Imagine starting with a confession, a bold claim, or a question that's been keeping you up at night. _Keep it real_, sprinkle in some relatable tales, and maybe, just maybe, readers won't want to leave.

### **The Win-Win of Engaging Reads**

Here's the scoop: Medium's model is a two-way street. Writers get to pen their passions and get rewarded for the eyeballs genuinely captivated by their words. For us readers, it's like finding a treasure trove of thoughtfully crafted stories worth our time and engagement.

### **In a Nutshell**

Medium's 30-second rule isn't just about numbers; it's a shoutout to the art of meaningful storytelling. It's a nudge for writers to pour heart and soul into their work. And for us, the readers? It's a reminder to slow down and savor the stories that resonate with us, one 30-second chunk at a time.

In this fast-paced digital age, Medium's stance on engagement over quick clicks is refreshing. Let's embrace it   —  by giving stories the attention they deserve and celebrating the writers who make our scrolling worthwhile.

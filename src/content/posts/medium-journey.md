_Series: Medium Monetization Tips_

## The Collapse

In the depths of uncertainty, where the shadows of doubt loomed more extensively with each passing day, I navigated the most challenging phase of my life.

ü§Ø It has been over ten months since I lost my full-time job, a cornerstone of my identity and security.

The domino effect of this loss has been profound and **painful**, touching every aspect of my personal and family life.

The journey from _stability_ to _instability_ was swift and merciless.

Drastic cuts in expenses became our new norm. The hardest part was looking into my children's eyes ‚Ää ‚Äî‚Ää ages 5 and 2 ‚Ää ‚Äî‚Ää and explaining why

> "daddy doesn't have a job anymore," why they couldn't have this or that, something they couldn't fully understand but felt deeply.


### The Loss Extended Beyond Just Material Things

- We had to sell our family van,
- Unemployment ran out months ago,
- Pulling the kids out of daycare brought challenges, especially when conducting Zoom interviews with two little ones who knew nothing of professional etiquette.

Worse, the looming threat of losing our house added a heavy dread that seemed to darken every moment.

üò¢ It felt like standing at the edge of an abyss, watching as the last pieces of our old life threatened to fall away.

## Friends of Medium (FOM) Program

Amidst this backdrop of loss and uncertainty, I stumbled upon the Friends of the Medium program.

Initially skeptical, I wondered if this could be my desperately searching lifeline.

The program is designed to provide increased financial support to writers, offering four times the reading time from a "Friend of Medium" member compared to a regular reader ["].

This model, which rewards excellent human writing, seemed promising but almost too good to be true ["].

‚úî Ô∏è Despite my skepticism, driven by desperation and hope, I decided to join.

The **$15 a month** cost was a gamble in our tight financial situation, but the potential payoff was worth the risk.

What followed was nothing short of **miraculous**. My engagement with the platform, fueled by the raw and authentic sharing of my experiences, resonated with others.

My stories of vulnerability, navigating through the challenges of job loss, financial instability, and the struggle to keep afloat while maintaining a semblance of normalcy for my children struck a chord.

### The Response was Overwhelming

My revenue from the platform grew exponentially, more than ten times what I had initially invested. While it hasn't replaced the full-time job I lost, my success on Medium has been a beacon of hope in a sea of uncertainty.

ü©∑ It's more than just the financial aspect; it's the validation and connection with others who appreciate and find value in my self-expression.

The Friends of the Medium program has provided a financial cushion and reignited a sense of purpose in me. It's shown me that there's value in vulnerability and that sharing our stories can help us heal and resonate with others profoundly.

While the journey is far from over, and the future remains **uncertain**, this experience has given me _hope_. I hope there's a way forward, that authenticity and vulnerability can pave the way for new beginnings, and that even in our darkest times, we can find light.

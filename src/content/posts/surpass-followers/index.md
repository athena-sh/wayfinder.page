Previously, I wrote the below article asking for community assistance to climb the Everest of Medium.com milestones â€¦ get 1000 followers!

## The 30-second rule

As writers, it's challenging enough to get noticed and, hopefully, monetized. Previously, I wrote a compelling and engaging article about the power of 50 claps.

The 30-second read time is a metric Medium leverages to decide article value and relevance. See the below post I found for more background.

That's it, short and sweet! Let's work together to learn and improve our writing success!

**1. Do you use a top sheet?**  
No, I don't use a top sheet, but my comforter has a cover.

**2. Do you use an electric or manual toothbrush?**  
I use an electric toothbrush.

**3. Do you like your toilet paper over or under?**  
Over, as my wife says, under is wrong and looks like a Mullet!

**4. Do you make your own soup or eat canned soup?**  
Both, though, often in a hurry, I'll use a simple box kit like Mrs. Grass (like I did tonight) and doctor it up with fresh veggies (green onions and fresh mushrooms typically). Most canned soups, except maybe Amy's bean varieties, aren't that good to me! My favorite soups to make from scratch are:

- White bean chicken chili
- Potato leek
- Chicken noodle
- Potato cheddar
- Chicken wonton
- French onion
- Chicken & wild rice
- Miso

**5. Do you skip or eat breakfast?**  
I eat breakfast. I occasionally have coffee and a two-egg cheese omelet with a vegetable or two or a frozen breakfast sandwich.

**6. Do you regularly drink protein shakes?**  
Lately, not much except when on the go with the kids.

**7. Do you use a real camera or a phone camera the most?**  
Phone camera.

**8. Do you still have a landline?**  
What's that? J/K, no, only a mobile phone.

**|9. Do you normally print or write in cursive when writing something?**  
Print and mainly in all caps. The proper case letters are simply larger.

**10. Do you need caffeine to get going in the morning?**  
I _need it_, or eventually, I'll experience a nasty headache from lack of caffeine. Only one cup, though.

#### Learning on the Job

In 1995, I left rural Michigan for Indianapolis, driven by a need for better job opportunities.

This move began my journey in the sales world, starting with a challenging role selling cologne and perfume on commission. Over the years, working in various sales positions, I've learned crucial tactics that I wish to share with you.

These are the 5 sales impulses that every successful salesperson understands.


**1. Greed**

- Best Buy: Their strategy is offering the best prices, appealing to customers' desire to make cost-effective purchases.
- Amazon: Suggests products from alternative sellers at lower prices, capitalizing on the customer's inclination to seek bargains.

**2. Fear of Loss**

- Etsy: Notifies shoppers of limited stock or items in other customers' carts, creating a _sense of urgency_ to purchase before missing out.
- Apple Keynotes: The anticipation and limited availability of new products like iPhones drive consumers to pre-order to ensure they get all their preferred models and colors.

**3. Sense of Urgency**

- Retailers have transformed Black Friday into an extended online shopping event, capitalizing on the urgency to grab deals before they're gone.

**4. Indifference**

- Successful salespeople project a sense of _indifference,_ creating an impression that the sale is not crucial to them, hence not pressuring the buyer. A personal experience at a bed store exemplifies this, where a retired salesman's engaging storytelling and relaxed demeanor led us to make a substantial purchase without feeling pressured.

**5. Association**

- Aligning your brand with influential figures or trends can significantly impact consumer choices. Nike's partnership with Michael Jordan in the 1980s is a classic example of this strategy.

#### Applying the Impulses

Understanding these impulses isn't just theoretical; it's about seeing them in action and recognizing their influence in everyday scenarios. Let's delve into some examples:

- **Newsletter Example 1:**

> "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born, and the day you find out why."  —  Mark Twain

This quote, often used in motivational content, triggers a _sense of urgency_ and _association,_ urging readers to discover their purpose.

- **Newsletter Example 2:**

> "A few years ago, I worked tirelessly. My goal? To accumulate material wealth and success."

Here, _greed_ is the driving force, showcasing the desire for material success as a motivator.

- **Newsletter Example 3:**

> "Don't Miss Future Issues"

This simple call to action instills a _fear of loss,_ suggesting that missing out on future issues might mean missing valuable information.

#### Audience Challenge

I encourage you, my readers, to actively engage with these concepts. As you go about your day, observe and identify these sales impulses in your interactions, advertisements, and even the newsletters in your inbox.

Challenge yourself to spot these tactics:

- When have you experienced a _sense of urgency_ in a buying decision?
- Can you recall a time when a salesperson used _indifference_ effectively?
- What examples of brand _association_ have influenced your purchasing choices?
- What are some examples you can pull from a newsletter in your inbox? Comment to share; I would love to know what you come up with!

Understanding these impulses is not about manipulation; it's about recognizing the underlying psychology in sales and marketing.

It helps craft strategies that are effective and respectful of the customer's decision-making process.

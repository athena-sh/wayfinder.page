_How to Harness 5 Powerful Impulses for Effective Sales Strategies._

#### Learning on the Job

Around 1995, I was living in Indianapolis, IN, originally from mid and northern Michigan. In Michigan, there were no colleges nearby.

The closest place to buy nicer clothes than K-mart was almost 2 hours south, only painful country roads that traverse a bunch of tiny villages (45 MPH to about 10 MPH, tractors, etc.).

I couldn't take it anymore after the automobile companies moved their manufacturing plants to another country (lower labor costs).

The state was suffering. Enter Indianapolis, a bustling local economy with HIRING signs everywhere; they were so ubiquitous that you eventually stopped noticing them.


I needed money fast, so I got caught up in an upside-down pyramid scam selling cologne and perfume out of a duffle bag, on the streets, etc. Any place we didn't see explicit signs saying no soliciting.

This was my first real sales job, 100% commission. As most do, even today, the top guy made the most money by not selling at all (not to end customers, at least; he sold us on the idea of selling for him, which allowed him to scale his efforts and make residual money each day).

He spent a few hours a week training us on how to sell his products. His leads did enter the field with us, leading by example.

😄 Honestly, I don't know what he did when we left the office to go sell; maybe he drove around in his nice-looking little blue BMW convertible.

I learned a lot working there and met plenty of cool people, like me, with good intentions but needed quick cash.

#### Applying the Impulses

The most important concepts I learned are the focal of this article, as I like helping and sharing with others.

After that job, I took on other sales positions intermittently throughout my career leading up to the advent of the tech-layoff recession of 2023 – 2024, which displaced me, leaving me still without work.

This is the first time in over 25 years I've been without a 9 – 5 job; however, the last time, it was only for a few days before I landed my next gig.

I might write more about my current crisis later, but for now, I want to kick this off by speaking about what we then called   —  the 5 sales impulses.

1. **Greed**

- Best Buy (having the best price)
- Amazon (you can buy it for less from this other seller; Amazon recommended)

**2. Fear of loss**

- Etsy   —  x number of this item already in the cart of other shoppers, inventory is low
- Your shopping cart expires in x minutes; then, it goes back into inventory so others can buy it
- Apple Keynote   —  The new iPhone initial inventory is pre-order only; if you want the color and options you are looking for, you better pre-order the week before strictly at the specific window; otherwise, it's gone, and it will be months before you have another chance to get what you want (both ways, total price)
- Premium brands create scarcity and artificially inflate their own supply, directly influencing demand

**3. Sense of urgency**

- Never-ending Black Friday sales it used to be only the Friday after Thanksgiving, and before the pandemic, eager shoppers would even wait outside or even camp outside a store in a long line to be the first set of shoppers to have full access to deals; some places like Target even have a killer deal or might even give something away if you are one of the first x numbers of shoppers; post-pandemic, most of the shopping is now online, and it extends until at least the following Monday, but it definitely ends and you won't get a better price after that if you procrastinate

**4. Indifference**

- As a seller, it doesn't matter if they buy because the next shopper will buy. It's a matter of a term we use in business, "opportunity" cost. As a seller, by investing too much time into a particular effort to sell, you forgo the ability to invest that time in another sales motion. It's the cost of not doing y, or even z, when you decide to focus solely on x.
- In sales, you want to instill this impulse in your target audience in a tactful/professional manner.
- The best indifferent sellers are confident and not bluffing their indifference; the prospective customer can fully sense it   —  we have all been there before. This happened to my wife and me a few years ago while browsing the mall when we decided to window shop beds. Our sales representative was a retired gentleman working there full time, very good at storytelling, and low pressure. He likes sharing his personal experiences with the beds and how they helped him and his wife sleep better. He discovered the oxygen-carbon levels in their bedroom weren't good, so the app suggested putting some plants in the room. Then, the bed gave them a better score, and before you knew it, they even stopped taking allergy pills! An hour later, a casual conversation, including his recent volunteer activities at his church, turned into a $10K+ sale for him. We even bought their brand bedding ancillary items because he personally recommended them and the materials. The sheets perfectly fits the bed and will not come off when you raise and lower it (e.g., Zero-G mode). We hardly ever visit the mail now as we are up to 3 little kids, but when we do, we peek into that store to see if he is there, at minimum, to say hi. See, he built a relationship with us and even derived his own personal brand outside of the store itself; we want to transact with/ him, not necessarily the store

**5. Association**

- The most common use case for this impulse is aligning your brand or products with influencers. Nike was way behind Adidas shoes in the 80s until they sponsored up-and-coming Michael Jordan (a movie on Netflix called Air if you are specifically interested in that story). Did you notice? I tried to be genuinely helpful by suggesting that movie because it correlates heavily with my example. I also, even if on accident, as it's a habit now (and can become a habit for you, too), associated this lesson I'm sharing with an influencer and with something bigger than myself, Netflix.

#### Applying the Impulses

While you can specialize in these areas independently, and many people and firms do, you will see opportunities to blend them. For example, in the bed sales representative story, he used a lot of association with tangible experiences, appearing authentic and indifferent.

There were no limited supplies (fear of loss), no sales (greed), or limited time promotions (sense of urgency). A good seller is someone you wouldn't mind getting to know, and they typically have a helpful personality.

🤭 They don't need you to buy this; they want to help!

_Memorize_ these and actively look for these impulses in your everyday experiences. They have always been there on plain site! The more it becomes automatic for you, the easier it will be to channel these skills to provide better services and products for your target personas (niches) / customers.

Refrain from thinking of it as a secret weapon where you are trying to pressure or trick customers into doing something they don't want. Did we need a new $10K+ bed replacement?

No, was our current bed starting to have a lump in the middle, over 5+ years old, and minor back pain from it? Yes. After we got into the car, we laughed and said wow, I can't believe we just did that; he was so helpful.

🛏 ️ Years later, I still look forward to sleeping in that bed! We don't regret it one bit!

Do upside-down pyramid scams/jobs really work? Like almost anything, if you focus enough and apply considerable effort.

Do I recommend it to everybody? NO. I was once even in Amway; does anyone remember that?

It's based out of Grand Rapids, Michigan … many years later, they were one of my B2B customers, and it was nice earning money from "Scamway" vs. losing money to them.

#### Audience Challenge

When you analyze your day-to-day interactions, realize when I say these are all around you, it's sometimes hidden in plain sight.

I gave in-person examples earlier, but here is a takeaway to consider analyzing moving ahead   —  look at any newsletter you are subscribed to.

_Do you ever find your Gmail inbox cluttered with emails that are only relevant for a short period?_


## Preface

<!-- ![Crafted using Athena's imaginative AI prompts on theMidjourneyplatform.](https://res-3.cloudinary.com/ddicetqs5/image/upload/f_auto,fl_force_strip,q_auto:best/v1/wayfinder-ghost-blog/0_wbZ1xvWEDk-H-W9j) -->

Think about those balance notifications from a highly fluctuating account, up-to-the-minute stock quotes, or short-lived discount offers.

These messages are essential momentarily but quickly lose their value. Wouldn't it be great if these emails could just vanish on their own after serving their purpose?

Well, with a simple Google Apps Script,

🪜 You can automate this process and keep your inbox streamlined.

Here's how you can set it up, even with just a basic level of IT know-how: 👇

### Step 1: Open Google Apps Script

Navigate to Google Apps Script and log in with your Google account. Then, start a new project by clicking `New Project`.

### Step 2: Paste the Script

In the script editor (a blank file named `Code.gs`), paste the following script:

```js
function deleteEmails() {
    var label = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName("YourLabelHere"); // Replace 'YourLabelHere' with your label name
    var interval = 5;  // Interval in minutes
    var date = new Date();
    var timeToCheck = date.getTime() - 1000 * 60 * interval; // Calculate 5 minutes ago
    var threads = label.getThreads();

    for (var i = 0; i < threads.length; i++) {
        if (threads[i].getLastMessageDate().getTime() < timeToCheck) {
            threads[i].moveToTrash();
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Customize the Script

Modify the script by replacing `'YourLabelHere'` with the name of the Gmail label you want to target.

### Step 4: Set Up a Trigger

Create an automatic trigger for the script:

- Click the clock icon on the left sidebar to open `Triggers`.
- At the bottom right corner, click `Add Trigger`.
- Select the `deleteEmails` function.
- Choose `Time-driven`, `Minutes timer`, and the interval as `Every 5 minutes`.

### Step 5: Save and Authorize

Save your project. Run the script once manually for authorization   —  a key step for operational functionality.

### Step 6: Testing

Test the script with a non-essential email labeled as specified. Wait for 5 minutes to check if it gets automatically deleted.

My use case for this script is managing GitHub Actions notifications. These alerts are crucial to know when a workflow has finished.

Still, the notification content itself isn't needed after a short period. So, I've set the duration for deletion at 5 minutes. This little automation keeps my inbox clean and focused, letting me stay on top of what's important without the clutter of outdated notifications.

Remember, this script is powerful and will delete emails, so use it wisely. First, ensure you test it thoroughly with non-critical emails and remain within Google's usage limits and policies.

Here's to a more organized and efficient email experience! 🍷 🥂🎉 ✨

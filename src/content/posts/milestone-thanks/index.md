## Community First

Yesterday, I wrote the post below in anticipation of reaching my goal of 2000 fantastic Medium followers ðŸ‘‡.

I kept interacting on my feed and checking my stats, thinking this wasn't happening; I set the expectations too high! Imposter syndrome started to kick in again â€¦


### Anticipation

Shortly before retiring for the evening, checking on the kids to ensure they were fast asleep, I checked my followers one last time before turning off my computer â€Š â€”â€Š**1997**! So close â€¦ I considered staying up to see what happens, almost like the anticipation of a presidential election. I decided to keep my schedule on track as the morning arrives quickly!

## Hope and Curiosity

I wanted to verify first thing in the morning but needed to do other things. Eventually, when I could check, I became anxious and a little nervous. Has anyone else experienced this?

My Medium phone app said 2K followers! I'm not sure what time it happened, but I'm thankful! Unfortunately, the app doesn't show you an exact count like the website does, boo â€¦

## Retrospective

Goals worth achieving are challenging. It's OKAY TO FAIL! Like this cold I'm catching from my son, it will have to get worse before it starts (keyword) to get better.

## Next Steps

- Newsletter (input welcome)
- Opening up the _followayfinder_ publication on Medium to interested writers

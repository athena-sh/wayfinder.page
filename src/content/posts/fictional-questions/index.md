## Only Talking with Our Favorite Fictional Characters

#### 1. Hermione Granger from "Harry Potter"

"All right, Hermione, here's a genuine question: how did you manage to keep everything spinning? Friends, school, and still having time to breathe! Have any spells that aren't so secret for us regular people?"

#### 2. Jay Gatsby from "The Great Gatsby"

"Jay, your outbursts are legendary. What's the secret to becoming Mr. Popular, and how do you wind down after the last patron leaves?"

#### 3. Elizabeth Bennet from "Pride and Prejudice"

"It must have been a lot of fun for you, Liz, to walk the tightrope between love and society. Are there any pearls of wisdom for us modern ladies who have yet to catch a good game?"

#### 4. Frodo Baggins from "The Lord of the Rings"

"Frodo, my friend, that hike with the Ring was incredible. How did you maintain your composure with all that weight on your shoulders and in your backpack?"

#### 5. Sherlock Holmes from "Sherlock Holmes"

"Sherlock, you're an expert at solving riddles! Could you share with us how you manage to activate those little grey cells in a challenging situation?"

#### 6. Katniss Everdeen from "The Hunger Games"

"You're the ultimate survivor, Katniss. What did you use as your motto to keep going when things became tough? And how did you handle the end of it all?"

#### 7. Atticus Finch from "To Kill a Mockingbird"

"Atticus, in a world that's often a hot mess of unfairness, how do you keep your cool and stick to your guns?"

#### 8. The Doctor from "Doctor Who" (BBC)

- "Doctor, who is your favorite companion and why?"
- "Bonus question: What happened to Clara?""

#### 9. Daenerys Targaryen from "Game of Thrones"

"Dany, you turned from being an outsider to a queen bee. Give us your finest advice for those attempting to move up the ladder and make a change."

#### 10. Bilbo Baggins from "The Hobbit"

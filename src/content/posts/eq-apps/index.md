I'm no emotions expert. Most days, I'm just trying to figure out why I'm suddenly crying over a dog food commercial or raging at my printer for having the audacity to run out of ink.

But in my stumbling journey towards something resembling emotional maturity, I've discovered that there are apps out there claiming to boost our emotional intelligence (EQ).


ðŸ’¾ So, being the tech-dependent millennial I am, I decided to give them a whirl.

Here's my utterly non-expert, slightly chaotic guide to the best emotional intelligence apps I've tried. Buckle up, folks â€“ we're in for an emotional roller coaster.

## 1. Mood Meter: The "What the Heck Am I Feeling?" App

First up on our journey through the land of feelings is Mood Meter. This app is like having a therapist in your pocket, minus the judgmental stares when you admit you ate an entire pint of ice cream for breakfast.

**What it does:** Mood Meter helps you identify and understand your emotions. It's got this fancy color-coded grid where you plot your mood, and then it asks you why you're feeling that way. It's like a game of emotional Battleship, but instead of sinking ships, you're trying to figure out why you're suddenly feeling "meh" on a Tuesday afternoon.

**My experience:** I spent way too much time trying to decide if I was "content" or just "not actively miserable." But you know what? It actually helped me realize that my emotions are more nuanced than just "good" or "bad." Who knew?

## 2. Empathy: The "Walk a Mile in Someone Else's Shoes" Simulator

Next up is Empathy, an app that promises to help you understand other people's perspectives. Because apparently, I needed an app to tell me that not everyone thinks exactly like I do. Mind. Blown.

**What it does:** Empathy presents you with various scenarios and asks you to consider how different people might feel or react. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, but instead of fighting dragons, you're navigating social situations without looking like a total doofus.

**My experience:** I found myself getting weirdly invested in the fictional characters' lives. I may or may not have shed a tear over a simulated breakup. But hey, at least I was feeling something, right?

**Emotional intelligence boost:** 8/10 empathetic nods

## 3. Breathe: The "Don't Lose Your Cool" Guru

Breathe is an app that helps you, well, breathe. Because apparently, I've been doing it wrong all these years.

**What it does:** Breathe offers guided breathing exercises and meditation sessions to help you manage stress and regulate your emotions. It's like having a zen master in your pocket, gently reminding you not to flip that table when your coworker microwaves fish in the office kitchen again.

**My experience:** At first, I felt silly sitting at my desk, eyes closed, breathing deeply. But after a while, I noticed I was less likely to lose my marbles over minor inconveniences. Progress!

**Emotional intelligence boost:** 6/10 deep breaths

## 4. Jour: The Digital Diary That Won't Judge You (Much)

Jour is a journaling app that promises to help you process your emotions through writing. Because apparently, my angsty teenage diary wasn't enough.

**What it does:** Jour provides daily prompts and questions to guide your journaling practice. It's like having a nosy friend who's really interested in your feelings, but won't gossip about them behind your back.

**My experience:** I found myself actually looking forward to my daily journaling sessions. It was like therapy, but without the awkward silences and eye contact.

**Emotional intelligence boost:** 8/10 introspective nods

## 5. EQ Test: The "How Emotionally Intelligent Are You, Really?" Quiz

EQ Test is exactly what it sounds like â€“ a test of your emotional intelligence. Because we all need more ways to feel inadequate, right?

**What it does:** EQ Test presents a series of questions and scenarios to assess your emotional intelligence. It's like those personality quizzes we all took in high school, but with less "Which Disney Princess Are You?" and more "Can You Actually Handle Adult Emotions?"

**My experience:** I took the test, got my results, and promptly Googled "Can you die from emotional incompetence?" But jokes aside, it actually gave me some insight into areas where I could improve.

**Emotional intelligence boost:** 7/10 self-aware grimaces

## 6. Happify: The "Turn That Frown Upside Down" Cheerleader

Happify is an app that claims to boost your happiness through science-based activities and games. Because who doesn't want to gamify their emotional well-being?

**What it does:** Happify offers a variety of activities, from gratitude exercises to mindfulness games, all designed to increase positive emotions and reduce stress. It's like having a relentlessly optimistic friend who's always trying to cheer you up, even when you just want to wallow in misery for a bit.

**My experience:** I was skeptical at first (shocking, I know), but I found myself actually enjoying the activities. And dare I say, I might have even felt a smidge happier?

**Emotional intelligence boost:** 7/10 hesitant smiles

## 7. Moodpath: The Mood Tracker for the Emotionally Challenged

Last but not least, we have Moodpath, an app that helps you track your moods over time. Because nothing says "emotional growth" like obsessively logging your feelings three times a day.

**What it does:** Moodpath prompts you to answer questions about your mood and experiences multiple times a day, then provides insights and patterns over time. It's like having a personal mood historian, documenting your emotional journey for future generations to study (or more likely, for you to cringe at later).

**My experience:** At first, I felt like I was being emotionally micromanaged. But after a few weeks, I started to notice patterns in my moods that I hadn't been aware of before. Like the fact that I'm always grumpy on Mondays (shocking revelation, I know).

**Emotional intelligence boost:** 8/10 raised eyebrows of self-discovery

## The Bottom Line: Can An App Really Make You Emotionally Intelligent?

After weeks of fumbling through these emotional intelligence apps, am I now an EQ genius? Well, not exactly. I still occasionally lose my cool over minor inconveniences, and I'm pretty sure I'll never fully understand why I cry during sappy commercials.

But you know what? I think I've made some progress. I'm more aware of my emotions, slightly better at understanding others, and marginally less likely to have a meltdown when things don't go my way.

These apps aren't magic bullets for emotional intelligence. They're more like training wheels â€“ they can help you get started, but eventually, you've got to learn to balance on your own.

So, if you're looking to boost your EQ and don't mind occasionally feeling like your phone is judging your emotional competence, give these apps a try. At worst, you'll have some funny stories about that time you cried over a simulated breakup in a mobile app. At best, you might just become a slightly more emotionally intelligent human being.

And hey, in a world where we're all just trying to figure out this whole "feelings" thing, every little bit helps, right?

ðŸ”† **Take away this**: Emotional intelligence isn't about being perfect. It's about being slightly less of an emotional disaster than you were yesterday. And if I can do it, anyone can. Now excuse me while I go have a heartfelt conversation with my mood-tracking app.

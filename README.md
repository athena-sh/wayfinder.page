## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **pnpm** >= 9

### Recent Fixes

**Donut Chart Components** - Fixed donut charts that were breaking in dark/light mode switching. All posts have been updated from old React component syntax (`<DonutChart>`) to new working markdown syntax (`::donut{}`). The fix includes:

- Proper CSS variable usage for theme-adaptive colors
- Removal of JavaScript color manipulation that was overriding theme colors
- Better hover states and interactions
- Charts now start from top (-π/2) for improved visual appearance

See the business-excellence post for a working example of the fixed donut chart syntax.

Hey there,

So I've been writing on Medium for a while now, and I keep mentioning this newsletter I have—"The Wayfinder Periodical," if you want to get fancy about it—but I've never actually, you know, _used_ it. Classic move, right?

Well, I'm finally doing it. And I'm going to be honest with you: I have no idea if this will work, if anyone will read it, or if I'll remember to send it regularly. But here we are.

## What You Can Expect

Look, I'm not going to pretend I have this newsletter thing figured out. I'm winging it, same as everything else. But here's what I'm thinking:

**Behind-the-scenes experiments:**
- Remember that Medium claps post where I broke my mouse? Yeah, more of that. Real numbers, real failures, real "I thought this would work but..." moments.
- What I'm testing this week, what's failing spectacularly, and occasionally what actually works (rare, but it happens).

**Real data, real failures:**
- I'll share actual numbers from my Medium monetization experiments, even when they're embarrassing.
- The messy reality behind the polished articles. Spoiler: it's messier than you think.

**Things I'm actually reading:**
- Not curated to make me look smart. Just stuff I'm reading that made me think, with my take on why it matters.
- Links to articles, tools, or resources that are actually useful, not just impressive.

**Early access:**
- Newsletter subscribers will see content before it hits Medium.
- Sometimes I'll ask for feedback on drafts before publishing. Your input might actually make my articles less terrible.

**Me figuring this out in real-time:**
- I'm learning alongside you, not teaching from some ivory tower.
- I'll probably make mistakes. I'll definitely forget to send this sometimes. I'm human, not a newsletter robot.

## What NOT to Expect

Let me set some realistic expectations here:

- **Polished, perfect content:** That's what the articles are for. This is more like a friend emailing you about their week.
- **Weekly consistency:** I'm aiming for bi-weekly, but I'm also realistic about my capacity. If I say bi-weekly and it becomes monthly, I'll tell you why.
- **Expert advice:** I'm not a newsletter expert. I'm not even a Medium expert. I'm just a writer trying to figure this out, same as you.
- **Sales pitches:** This isn't about selling you stuff. It's about sharing what I'm learning and building a community of people who are also figuring things out.

## Why Now?

Good question. I've had this newsletter set up for months. I've mentioned it in articles. I've even linked to it. But I never actually sent anything.

Partly because I was overthinking it. Partly because I wasn't sure what value I could provide. And partly because, let's be real, starting new things is scary.

But here's the thing: I keep doing these experiments—testing Medium monetization strategies, trying different content formats, breaking expensive mice in the name of science—and I think there's value in sharing that process, not just the polished results.

So here we are. Me, finally using this newsletter thing. You, reading this (hopefully). Us, figuring this out together.

## What's Next?

First real newsletter coming in two weeks. I'm thinking it'll be about my latest Medium experiment—something I'm testing right now that may or may not work. You'll get the data, the failures, and the occasional win.

Until then, I'm over here trying to figure out how to make this actually valuable. And probably overthinking the subject line for the next one.

## Your Turn

Here's where you come in: Reply and tell me what you'd want to see in a newsletter like this. I'm all ears (and slightly terrified, but that's normal).

What experiments are you running? What's failing for you? What questions do you have about Medium, content creation, or just... figuring things out?

This isn't a one-way street. I want to hear from you. Your questions might become newsletter content. Your feedback might shape what I write about. Your experiments might inspire mine.

So hit reply. Let's make this a conversation, not a monologue.

P.S. If you know someone else who's trying to figure this whole content creation thing out, feel free to share this with them. The more of us winging it together, the better.

P.P.S. I'm still not 100% sure about this subject line. If you have a better idea, let me know. I'm open to suggestions. (See? Learning alongside you, not pretending to have it all figured out.)

**Next newsletter:** December 28, 2024 (bi-weekly schedule, but we'll see how this goes)

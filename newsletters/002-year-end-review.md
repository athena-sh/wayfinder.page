Hey there,

So... I promised this newsletter by the 28th. It's the 29th.

I could make excuses. I could pretend I planned this as some meta-commentary on perfectionism. But the truth is simpler: **I'm human, I missed my own deadline by one day, and that pretty much sums up my entire 2025.**

Close enough counts in horseshoes and newsletter schedules, right?

## The Year I Went All-In on Weird Experiments

Let me walk you through the absolutely chaotic year that was 2025 on Medium.

If you'd told me at the start of the year that I'd be:
- Writing multi-part series about selling NVIDIA stock (before everyone else)
- Ditching my iPhone after 10 years and documenting the whole messy transition
- Publishing blog structure guides that people actually used
- Calling out AI productivity hype as theater
- And somehow building an actual community around honest content creation

...I would have thought you were describing someone who had their life together. Spoiler: I still don't. But somehow it worked anyway.

## The Hits (And Yeah, There Were Some)

**The Tech Hot Takes That Actually Hit:**

I went from iPhone to Google Pixel in March after **10 years** as an Apple loyalist. The breaking point? Apple's pain-in-the-ass authentication, daily lockouts, and refusing to add USB-C until the EU forced their hand.

I wrote [two](https://wayfinder.page/posts/iphone-pixel/) [articles](https://wayfinder.page/posts/pixel-switch/) about ditching my iPhone and Verizon for a Pixel on Google Fi. The iPhone piece covered everything from adjusting to new gestures (swipe up for search instead of down—hardest part of the switch) to discovering that Google's Night Sight mode made my old iPhone camera look like a potato.

I expected crickets. Instead, I got readers messaging me **months later** saying they made the switch because of those articles. People who'd been iPhone users for a decade made the leap based on my honest "this is weird but also kind of great" take.

That's weird, right? Like, I'm not a tech reviewer. I'm just someone who got frustrated with their phone bill ("Wait… I didn't agree to donate a kidney for this service") and documented the chaos. But apparently honesty about adjusting to new gestures and actually comparing battery life in real-world use resonates more than polished reviews.

**The NVIDIA Calls (Before It Was Cool):**

In late November, I published [three articles in three days](https://wayfinder.page/posts/sell-nvidia/) calling for people to sell NVIDIA stock when it was near **\$5 trillion market cap**—worth more than Japan's entire GDP.

The takes were:
1. General "sell before Wall Street figures it out"
2. Competition is coming for Jensen's throne
3. The valuation math that doesn't make sense

The thesis? NVIDIA's valuation assumes permanent 80-90% market share in AI chips, 73%+ gross margins forever, and zero impact from AMD, custom ASICs, or the AI spending boom hitting a wall. **All four assumptions have to stay true simultaneously** for the stock to be fairly valued.

Oh, and Peter Thiel's macro fund dumped their entire 40% NVIDIA position and rotated to Microsoft and Apple. Michael Burry reduced his stake. 342 hedge funds trimmed positions in Q3.

I don't know if anyone actually sold. But I know I was early on questioning the hype when everyone else was still buying the dip. And being early on the internet is basically being wrong until you're suddenly right.

**The AI Productivity Theater Piece:**

This one surprised me. ["The AI Productivity 'Revolution' Is Mostly Theater"](https://wayfinder.page/posts/ai-productivity-theater/) got way more traction than I expected.

The core argument? **Your AI agent just saved you 10 minutes drafting an email. Then you spent 20 minutes fixing it, 15 more explaining why it was wrong, and another 30 in a meeting about "AI governance." Congrats—you automated yourself into overtime.**

We obsess over cost-to-generate (so cheap! so fast!) and ignore cost-to-correct (oops). A randomized trial with experienced open-source devs found they actually worked **~19% slower** when AI tools were allowed. Analysts now expect **>40% of agentic-AI projects to be canceled by 2027** due to costs, unclear value, and weak risk controls.

Turns out people are tired of being told AI will 10x their output when they're still struggling to answer emails and their "productivity gains" vanish when you include verification time.

The follow-ups about [autonomous agents needing babysitting](https://wayfinder.page/posts/agent-hype-vs-reality/) and AWS outages being blamed on AI? Those did well too. Pattern recognition: **people appreciate when you call BS on hype cycles with actual data.**

**The Blog Structure Guide:**

[This piece](https://wayfinder.page/posts/blog-structure-mastery-guide/) was supposed to be a simple article about fixing bounce rates. It turned into a 5,000+ word guide that people actually bookmarked and used.

The opening: "Three months ago, I was staring at my analytics dashboard in complete disbelief. **85% bounce rate.** Average time on page: 47 seconds."

The problem? I wasn't a bad writer—I was a terrible architect. My blog posts were like houses built without blueprints: beautiful ideas scattered everywhere with no clear path for visitors to follow.

The guide covered:
- The 4-second audition (Nielsen Norman Group shows 17% of page views last less than 4 seconds)
- Progressive disclosure method (problem → solution → implementation → reinforcement)
- Visual hierarchy that actually works (subheadings every 200-300 words, short paragraphs, strategic white space)

I learned something: **When you solve a real problem people are having, they don't care if your newsletter is a day late.** They just want the solution.

## The Misses (And Boy, Were There Misses)

**The Packing Guide That Nobody Asked For:**

"12 Secret Packing Tricks That 90% of Travelers Desperately Want" was... not it. I tried to replicate the ChatGPT tricks article format with packing tips. It bombed.

Lesson learned: **You can't force a format onto a topic that doesn't fit.** Also, nobody desperately wants packing advice from me.

**The AWS Article That Was Too Inside Baseball:**

The AWS outage piece did okay, but not great. I think I went too technical and lost people who weren't already in the cloud computing world.

**Every Time I Tried to Game the Algorithm:**

Any article where I tried to optimize for SEO over honesty? Crickets. Every. Single. Time.

The algorithm doesn't reward clever tricks. It rewards content that people actually want to read and share. Took me way too long to internalize that.

## The Biggest Lesson: Community Over Clicks

Here's the thing I didn't expect: the articles that performed best weren't the ones with the clickiest titles or the most SEO optimization.

They were the ones where I was honest about:
- Not knowing what I'm doing
- Making mistakes publicly
- Sharing real numbers (even embarrassing ones)
- Calling out BS when I see it
- Treating readers like intelligent humans, not engagement metrics

The [Medium claps article](https://wayfinder.page/posts/medium-claps/) where I worried about breaking my expensive mouse? That resonated because it was real.

The [Friends of Medium piece](https://wayfinder.page/posts/medium-friend/) about supporting writers? People connected with the community-first approach.

The [30-second rule article](https://wayfinder.page/posts/medium-30-second-rule/)? It helped people understand how the platform actually works, not how we wish it worked.

And the newest one about [gifting Medium memberships](https://wayfinder.page/posts/gift-medium-membership/)? That's about recognizing the people who show up for you. Community, not commerce.

## The Comments That Made It Worth It

Those emoji flowers in the comments on my latest piece? That made my week.

"Excellent work. You presented these ideas with great clarity and flow." — Someone who gets what I'm trying to do.

"Haha, love the honesty. You're basically teasing your audience with a newsletter that doesn't exist yet, bold move." — Fair. But hey, here we are!

"Love this so much, Athena, the honest I have no idea what I'm doing energy is exactly what makes this newsletter worth subscribing to 😃" — This comment. This is why I keep writing.

The transparency and vulnerability aren't bugs. They're features.

## What I'm Taking Into 2026

**More experiments, more honesty, less optimization:**

I'm done trying to game the system. The only "hack" that works is writing stuff people actually want to read and being honest about the process.

**The pay-it-forward mentality:**

This showed up in the gift membership article, but it's bigger than that. I want to build a community where we lift each other up, not compete for scraps.

**Shorter cycles between idea and execution:**

The best articles were the ones I wrote quickly, when the idea was fresh. The ones I overthought? Usually worse.

**More newsletters (hopefully on time):**

I said bi-weekly in the first newsletter. I'm zero for one on that promise. But I'm learning. You're learning. We're all just humans trying to make things.

## The Real Numbers (Because Transparency)

I'm not going to share exact revenue (that feels weird), but I will say:

- Published 16 substantial articles in 2025 (not counting dozens of smaller pieces)
- Switched phones, called market tops, questioned AI hype, and built a guide people actually use
- Sent 1 newsletter before this one (so... 100% increase! 🎉)
- Built something that feels like a community, not just an audience

The revenue went up. The follower count went up. But more importantly: **the quality of engagement went way up.**

I'd rather have 100 readers who care than 10,000 who just skim and bounce.

## What's Actually Next

**Short-term (January):**
- I'm working on something about the [December resolution hack](https://wayfinder.page/posts/start-new-years-resolution-today/) and why starting early matters
- Maybe a piece about the tech predictions that actually came true in 2025
- Definitely more honesty about what's working and what's bombing

**Medium-term (Q1 2026):**
- I want to do more community-focused content
- Possibly a series on sustainable creator economies (not the get-rich-quick BS)
- More behind-the-scenes experiments with real data

**Long-term (2026 and beyond):**
- Keep building this thing where honesty and community matter more than metrics
- Help more writers figure out that the "secret" is just being real
- Not break any more expensive mice in the name of science

## Your Turn (Seriously, I Want to Hear From You)

The comments on the gift membership article got me thinking: **Who are YOUR biggest supporters this year?**

Not your biggest follower counts. Not the people with the most claps. The ones who showed up consistently, engaged thoughtfully, and made the work feel worthwhile.

**Reply and tell me:**
- What was your biggest win in 2025?
- What bombed spectacularly?
- What are you doing differently in 2026?
- Who's your unsung hero supporter?

I'm reading every reply. And yeah, they might inspire future content. That's how this works—we learn from each other.

## The Actual Takeaway

I missed my newsletter deadline by one day. I published some articles that worked and some that bombed. I switched phones, questioned AI hype, and tried to build community over just chasing clicks.

And you know what? That's fine. **The goal isn't perfection. It's progress. And connection. And figuring this out together.**

So here's to 2026: More experiments. More honesty. More newsletters (hopefully closer to on-time). More community building. Less algorithm chasing.

Let's do this.

P.S. I know I said this would be bi-weekly and it's been... longer than that. I'm working on it. Accountability is hard. But I'm trying.

P.P.S. If you're reading this and thinking "I should recognize my biggest supporter," do it. Gift them a Medium membership. Write them a note. Tag them in a comment. The people who show up for us deserve to know it matters.

P.P.P.S. Next newsletter will be more timely. Probably. I'm human. Cut me some slack. 😅

**Next newsletter:** Mid-January 2026 (aiming for bi-weekly, but we'll see how this goes)

**Want early access to articles?** Reply to this email and I'll add you to the early-reader list for 2026 content.

**Know someone figuring out content creation?** Forward this to them. We're all just humans trying to make things. Might as well support each other.
